Here is another game I made in high school, entitled_Zorua Saves the World!_\
In this game, you play as the Dark-type Pok√©mon Zorua, and are on a dungeon-delving quest to stop all the life on earth from being sucked away. All sprites and art in the game are created by myself, and characters belong to Nintendo. Game was coded in GML on Game Maker 8.\
\
This is only a**playable test level**. Possibly the most solid coding for an adventure game that I've created so far.
