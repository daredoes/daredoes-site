This game was my senior project in the Arcata Arts Institute. I spent so much time on getting the programming to be solid, that the story I had planned never got to be implemented. You can choose between two different characters - me as a high school student, or me as an elementary student. The elementary student version is hard mode, due to much less advantageous attacks. (Sort of like me in elementary school!) Stats for the player can be modified to suit the build you would like.
All sprites and art in this game are made by myself, and I coded the game in GML using Game Maker 8.

This game stayed in the early stages, butI recommend **trying this one**!
