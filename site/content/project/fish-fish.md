_**Fish-Fish**_ was a small project I made for my Python scripting class. It's a simple fishing game, with a market to sell caught fish to, and to buy bait from. Fish are reeled in by pressing the arrow keys at a certain speed, with difficulty changing through different fish. Most of the game was programmed myself, along with fellow game designer Rudro De. All art stayed at the placeholder stage.\
â€‹All written in Python 2.7 using Pygame.
