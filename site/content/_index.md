Hello! I'm Monique, a determined aspiring artist with a passion for bringing to life what cannot be explained in words through art. 

The ability to visually illustrate not only my own- but others ideas and experiences is something I love and continue to practice with my BFA.

As a story artist my goal is not to just evoke emotion, but to leave a lasting impression that encourages or even inspires people to think, act, and grow.
