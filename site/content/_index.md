My name is Sierra! (like the mountains, yes) I am a game designing artist who loves to capture the completely strange and bizarre of the world. I have been making small games for 5 years now, and am currently pursuing a degree in Game Design Art to further my understanding of interesting design, and how to better tell stories through interactive arts.
