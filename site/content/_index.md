Hello, I'm Monique! I am a graduate from California College of the Arts with a BFA in Animation. I currently reside in the Los Angeles area following my passion in illustration and storytelling.

The ability to visually illustrate not only my own- but others ideas and experiences is something I always strive for and continue to practice.
