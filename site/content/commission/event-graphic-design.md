Posters of all kinds are some of my favorite pieces to do. Whether it's for a music show, a school event, or anything, I can work something interesting out.\
\
With these, I'm open to any sort of style or visions that clients may have in mind; it's about the event more than anything else.\

_To be honest, all the examples to the left are a few years old. It's been awhile since I've had a graphic design project, and since then my skills have greatly improved, so I'd love to see what I could create now._
