At Bird I worked on a team called New Ventures. We focused on ways to expand Bird beyond the core business, and rapidly implemented them.
A large majority of my time was spent working on BirdPay, a QR-based payment solution provided by Bird.

Working with such a large team of talented people at Bird was an honor. I had an amazing mentor, who always pushed me in the right ways to be a better engineer. I worked with an incredible team of people who were bright, fun, and communicative. The engineering organization as a whole was made up of so many uniquely talented people, all with such incredible backgrounds. My time at Bird is a time I'll never forget.
